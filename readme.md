# Dev Tabs

## Chrome Extension for Developers - Replaces your NewTab and Homepage in Chrome

### Github Feed

The [Github](https://www.github.com) feed on the right hand side of the page lists the first 10 repo's in you profile. This makes it easy to quickly access a good portion of your repos.

I used a library called [GithubFeed](https://github.com/samwx/GithubFeed), from 'samwx' to implement this. The lib is very well documented however, I did have to alter the code slightly as well as the CSS so it matched the Dev Tabs page.

Once you open the extension for the first time, click the settings cog in the middle of the page. The first setting is the 'Github Feed'. If you just put your Github Username in the input and save it, when you go back to the main page it will automatically load your Feed on the right hand side of the screen.

### Github Calendar

The [Github](https://www.github.com) calendar is was integrated with a library from IonicaBizau. The library is [github-calendar.js](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-calendar), and can display your github contribution calendar. Very well explained lib, and is responsive. I changed the original styles that came with it to match the basic styles of the Dev Tabs page.

When you first start the extension, look under the weather info at the center of the page and click on the settings cog. On the settings page just click on the 'Github Calendar' selection on the left and fill in your github username. No quotes or anything and click save.
